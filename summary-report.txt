1. Introduction
──────────────────────────────

The codebase under review is a modular and well-structured repository that contains the main application logic, configuration files, and various supporting modules. It is maintained with an emphasis on code quality, adherence to security best practices, and routine automated scans to ensure a secure development lifecycle.

2. Summary
──────────────────────────────

The security posture of the codebase is currently strong, with the SARIF analysis reporting no vulnerabilities. There are no identified issues across any severity levels (critical, high, medium, or low), and there are no associated CVSS scores to report. This indicates that the codebase does not currently have known security weaknesses impacting its integrity.
